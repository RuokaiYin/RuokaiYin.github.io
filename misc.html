    <p>I love soccer, dogs, and Murakami Haruki. I play piano since pre-K and have also been an amateur drummer since high school.</p>
    <p>I listen to many music genres, some of my picks:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY">Yellow - Coldplay</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-JD2bnNQvY">Nocturne Op.9 No.1 - Chopin</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1sQ2kTKUB0">阿司匹林(What can I say) - Wang Yitai</a></p>
